# Minimalistic Habit Tracker App (Flutter)
Introduction
This is a simple and intuitive habit tracker app that helps you to develop and maintain healthy habits. You can add habits, track your progress, and set reminders to keep yourself accountable. The app is built using Flutter, a cross-platform framework for building high-quality, natively compiled applications. This uses 'Hive' for local storage database.
